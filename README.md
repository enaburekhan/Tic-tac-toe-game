# OOPs-tic-tac-toe

> In this project, we're required to create a Tic Tac Toe Game using Ruby with OOP concepts.

This project is split into 4 milestones, which are:

- Setting up the project
- Designing the user interface
- Creating the game logic
- Writing the game instructions

The main goal of this project is to ensure the mastery of the methods ruby provides and to learn how to replicate them using basic coding knowledge.

Below is a basic demonstration of how the tic tac toe game works

## Steps to play the game : 

- Player 1 is assigned the key 'X' and Player 2 is assigned the key '0'.

- The game starts with an empty board.

- Players are prompt to enter the position for their respective key.

- The game continues until we have a winning combination or the grid is full and it is a draw.

- Winning combinations are full row, full column or full diagonal.

## How to install

- Download or clone the repository's files github repo
- Have Ruby 2.7 installed
- Once repo is downloaded to local directory, in you console run cmd: main
- Enjoy the game!
